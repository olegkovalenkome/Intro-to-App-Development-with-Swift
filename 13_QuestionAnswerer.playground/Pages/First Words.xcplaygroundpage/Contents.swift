/*:
 ## First Words
 In this exercise you’ll make a function that gives different answers depending on the first word of the question. The `hasPrefix()` method tests if a string begins with another string:
*/
"swift programming".hasPrefix("swift")
"swift programming".hasPrefix("programming")
//: - callout(Exercise): Amend the function and tests below to respond to different first words. How about adding answers for who, what, why, and how questions?
func responseTo(question: String) -> String {
    
    if question.hasPrefix("hello") {
        return "Why, hello there"
    } else if question.hasPrefix("where") {
        return "To the North!"
    } else if question.hasPrefix("why") {
        return "Because sun is shining☀️"
    } else if question.hasPrefix("who") {
        return "Exactly not me"
    } else if question.hasPrefix("what") {
        return "Hmmm... Really don't know 🤷🏻‍♂️"
    } else {
        return "That really depends"
    }
}

responseTo(question: "hello there!")
responseTo(question: "where should I go on holiday?")
responseTo(question: "what is the capital of France?")
//: You may have noticed that `where` works, but `Where` or `WHERE` does not. You’ll learn how to deal with that on the next page.
